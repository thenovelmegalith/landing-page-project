## Development Approach

1. **Start with HTML**: Begin by adding all the content to the page using HTML. Focus on one section at a time, starting from the top.
2. **Style with CSS**: Once the HTML structure is in place, move on to styling the page using CSS. Use Flexbox for layout and alignment.
3. **Iterate and Refine**: Go back and forth between HTML and CSS as needed to refine the design and ensure everything looks good.
4. **Responsive Design**: While the primary focus is on desktop layout, basic responsiveness can be added using media queries.
